# Data Structures

A comprehensive repository that explains various data structures and provides code examples for implementing them from their abstract definitions. The goal is to help you understand the fundamental concepts of data structures, their operations, and to see how they can be brought to life through code.

## Introduction

This repository contains explanations and implementations of common data structures. Each data structure folder contains:
- A **markdown** file with a description of the data structure and its abstract operations.
- One or more **code files** showing an example implementation (in one or more programming languages).

**Key Concepts:**
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and how they map to concrete data structures.
- Common operations (insertion, deletion, searching, etc.) and their complexities.
- The trade-offs and appropriate use cases for each data structure.

## Data Structures Covered

The repository aims to include (but is not limited to) the following data structures:

- **Arrays**  
  - Explains how arrays store elements and how indexing works.  
  - Common operations: insert, delete, update, traverse.

- **Linked Lists**  
  - Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.  
  - Operations: insertion, deletion, searching, reversing.

- **Stacks**  
  - LIFO principle.  
  - Operations: push, pop, peek.

- **Queues**  
  - FIFO principle.  
  - Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek.  
  - Variations: Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.

- **Trees**  
  - Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.  
  - Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).

- **Heaps**  
  - Min-Heap and Max-Heap concepts.  
  - Operations: insert, extract, heapify.

- **Hash Tables**  
  - Hash functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing).  
  - Operations: insert, delete, search.

- **Graphs**  
  - Representation: adjacency list, adjacency matrix.  
  - Traversals: BFS, DFS.  
  - Common algorithms for shortest paths, cycle detection, etc.

- **Tries (Prefix Trees)**  
  - Usage in string manipulation and searching.  
  - Operations: insert, search, delete.

*More data structures may be added in the future!*
